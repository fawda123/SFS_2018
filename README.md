## Abstract

Increased frequency of toxic cyanobacteria blooms in California lakes has negatively affected designated uses.  Synthesis of existing datasets with remote sensing methods to develop a risk assessment model at the landscape scale is currently being explored in California.  The goal is to quantify the likelihood or ‘risk’ of each lake of exceeding a eutrophication endpoint that is statistically related to bloom occurrence.  Lake characteristics were compiled at the lake, immediate catchment, and watershed scale using the newly developed LakeCat database.  These data were combined with in situ chlorophyll measurements and estimates derived from remote sensing products to develop a statistical model that identifies at-risk lakes for prioritization.  Model development followed a stratified approach using a lake classification scheme where independent relationships between chlorophyll and bloom occurrence were identified.  The results revealed distinct differences in the risk-response model related to latitudinal variation, watershed position, and basin type.  These initial models are expected to guide the development of a statewide bioassessment method for lakes that, combined with existing assessment methods, will provide a comprehensive approach for surface water management in California.
